### Todos API

*Almost every "todo" tutorial I can find for the latest javascript or cross platform 
mobile framework either has no backend at all, or uses Firebase, or some commercial derivative
thereof.  I built this API free for anyone to use, hoping that we'll start seeing more tutorials
that take into account things like user authentication.*

#### Features:
- Built using Laravel Lumen 8 and php 8.1
- Swagger documenation
- Google Recaptcha
- Mailgun integration
- Custom Authentication middleware
- CORS middleware
